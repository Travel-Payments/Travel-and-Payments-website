              <p>
                A European regulatory requirement under PSD2 that mandates
                multi-factor authentication for online payments, such as
                combining a password with a fingerprint. This aims to enhance
                security and reduce fraud in digital transactions.

              <h3>Dynamic Authentication</h3>
              <p>
                An adaptive security process that adjusts the authentication
                method based on the perceived risk of a transaction or user
                behavior. A higher-risk transaction may trigger multi-factor
                authentication, while a routine login might not.

                A temporary hold placed on funds by a merchant to ensure
                sufficient funds are available to cover a transaction, typically
                in card payments. For example, hotels or car rentals place holds

                An authentication protocol that adds an additional security
                layer for online credit and debit card transactions, requiring
                the cardholder to complete an extra verification step, such as

                during a payment transaction to confirm that the authorization
